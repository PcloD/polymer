Polymer is a research framework for spatial interaction and real-time rendering, presently targeting C++14 and desktop-class OpenGL on Windows. It was built to explore AR/VR prototyping tools as a core concept in-engine. It is inspired by projects such as NVIDIA's [Falcor](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor), Google's [Lullaby](https://github.com/google/lullaby), and Microsoft's [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity).  


## Features

* Physically-based gamma-correct forward renderer with MSAA
* Data-driven entity-component architecture with custom RTTI
* Lightweight, object-oriented wrapper for modern OpenGL
* Hot-reloadable assets including GLSL shaders
* Asset import for common geometry and texture formats
* Desktop scene editor application with JSON serialization
* OpenVR integration
